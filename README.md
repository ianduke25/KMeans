# Homework Assignment: Exploring K-Means Algorithm

## Objective
This Jupyter notebook is designed as a comprehensive guide and assignment for understanding and implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to familiarize students with the fundamentals of K-Means clustering, its implementation, and practical applications such as image compression.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with data science and machine learning concepts
- Prior exposure to numpy and matplotlib is beneficial

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This notebook is compatible with Python 3.x. You will also need Jupyter or JupyterLab to open the `.ipynb` file.

1. Clone or download the notebook to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyterlab
```

## Running the Notebook
Navigate to the notebook's directory and launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
or
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `KMeans.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.

## Tasks Overview
- **Task 1**: Implement the K-Means algorithm from scratch, understanding its core principles.
- **Task 2**: Explore the algorithm's complexity and discuss its performance implications.
- **Task 3**: Apply K-Means for image compression, demonstrating a practical application of the algorithm.
- **Additional Tasks**: Engage with further exercises to deepen your understanding of K-Means and its applications.

## Support
For questions or issues, please refer to your course instructor or submit an issue in the repository (if applicable).
