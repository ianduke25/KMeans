## Objective
This Jupyter notebook is designed as a comprehensive guide for manually implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to demonstrate the fundamentals of K-Means clustering, its implementation, and practical applications such as image compression using a photo of my cute cat, Hummus. The notebook additionally includes clustering visualizations to help users better understand the algorithm and experiments to test the time complexity of the algorithm.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with data science and machine learning concepts
- Prior exposure to numpy and matplotlib is beneficial

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This notebook is compatible with Python 3.11. You will also need Jupyter or JupyterLab to open the `.ipynb` file.

1. Clone or download the notebook to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyterlab
```

## Running the Notebook
Navigate to the notebook's directory and launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
or
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `KMeans.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.
